	<p style="color:#ffffff;text-align:center">Dear Televise users,<br><br>
	Over the past year, we have commited ourselves to providing you with a high standard of quality Robloxian television content, and have become one of the most watched television providers within the industry.<br><br>
	However, as of recent, the industry has started to change, to the disbenefit of television services and their operation. Ever since the closure of Original Livestream in July of 2018, the path for the industry has been rocky and unsure, with many channels left to die due to not being able to move to a more suitable platform.<br><br>
	We believe that, due to the movement of many channels towards other services such as Viloud and Youtube, that the operation of a standard Robloxian television service is no longer reliable as much more viewership and exposure can be achieved through platforms such as Youtube.<br><br>
	Due to the industry's rockier state at the moment, ours and many other networks' goal is to stabilise the future of the industry and preserve it, and the only current reliable method to do this is to move away from streaming services such as Televise.<br><br>
	Because of this, Televise and its services will be ceasing operation starting today, on the 23rd of October 2018. Thank you all for joining us along this journey, and we hope to see you join us on future projects.<br><br>
	If you would like an alternative streaming services to Televise, we recommend checking out <a href="http://rotv.tk">roTV.</a><br>
	Thank you again, and for one last time, #JumpIn.</p>
